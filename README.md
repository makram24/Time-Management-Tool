here's an example of how you could add delete and reminder functionality to the time management tool using JavaScript and HTML.

In this example, when the user clicks the "New Task" button, a prompt will appear asking for the task description, due date and reminder time. The date,reminder and delete button will be added to the task element and will be displayed with the task when it is added to the task list. When the user clicks the delete button, the task will be removed from the task list.
Also, the reminder is set using the reminder time entered by the user, the reminder will be displayed to the user in the form of an alert message.

Keep in mind that this is just a basic example and you might need to add more functionality, such as error handling for invalid date inputs, validation of date inputs, etc.
